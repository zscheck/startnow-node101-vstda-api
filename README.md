Using express, the program first responds to with all of the objects in the dataset to to the route /api/TodoItems.  It then responds to the next GET request with the matching todoItemId.  It can also POST an additional object to the dataset, or overwrite one.  Finally, it can DELETE an object with a matching todoItemId.
